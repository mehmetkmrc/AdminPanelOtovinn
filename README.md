# AuthProjects
This is an educational project made for deeper understanding of these concepts.
In this project I am learning to implement user Authentication and Authorization into my main page, the app who can see photos and admin can load pages, both manually implementing and using Microsofts ready made codes to scaffold. 

# Features
This project has the following implemented into it:
* Authentication
* Two Factor Authentication
* QRCode generation for Two Factor Authentication
* Authorization based on Roles
* The ability to create Roles and Claims for users
* Creating and manging users and Roles in an easy to use environment
* Going to home page to see photos or load photos if you are on admin role. 

# Goals
My goal from this project is to learn how to implement Authentication and Authorization in .NET Core. 
Have a deeper understanding of this system and its common needs which are needed in many real world projects.
This helps me create and design different user systems based on customer needs and create custom user systems which implement and change the existing one.

# Notes
Some features of this project may not work as planned but that is because I was only trying to grasp a deep understanding of the problem and the feature.
In general debugging the application shouldn't be hard. I just didn't want to put too much time in a test project created only for educational purposes. 
I would rather tackle with these problems in real world projects.
